# B-Zero Retro Game 

## A recreation of an old school physics-based 2D platformer.

This is my very first solo project where I attempted to build all the core functionalities of Bound Plus also known as B-Zero - a 2003 puzzle game made in Japan. You can find a demonstration of how the original title looked like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS3yqmF_LCU). As of now the game has the folliwing features:

* The first 7 levels
* A basic implementation of the game's physics
* All of the different tile types and their corresponding logic.
* Logic for handling losing and winning.

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/gregpolack/b-zero
```

2. Run the following script from the 'b-zero' directory:

```
./main.sh
```
